## Description of the course

This course in an introduction to data management, data visualization, and statistical
inference. It is intended for early-stage graduate students with no background in
statistics. No prior coursework (undergraduate or graduate) in statistics or
programming is assumed. The primary objective of the course is to get students up to
speed with respect to organization, manipulation, visualization, and analysis of data,
using the R statistical language. The emphasis on application is strong, with the goal
of enabling students (after the course) to analyze their own data sets with confidence
using reasonable approaches, and, when faced with more difficult analysis problems,
to be able to communicate their inference objectives clearly to expert analysts.
Students will learn to organize and analyze data sets in the form of RStudio projects,
using R Markdown files to reproducibly capture and render code, visualizations, and
analyses. In-class exercises will be delivered in the form of pre-formatted R
Notebooks, which can be interactively executed by students without having to write
all code from scratch.

The course is designed to acquaint students primarily with univariate (single
response variable) analysis. Multivariate analysis will be covered in the Advanced
Biostatics 2-course series offered during the Fall and Winter terms. Examples and
assignments in class will include data sets primarily from the biological sciences,
including studies of morphological and molecular traits, behaviors, ecological
questions, and clinical studies. For specific statistical topics covered in class, please
see the course goals and tentative schedule below.

## Course goals:

- Properly organize and format primary data and metadata files for analysis
- Learn programming fundamentals of the R statistical language, including
    objects, functions, iteration, and simulation.
- Make publication-quality data visualizations, including scatterplots, boxplots,
    frequency distributions, mosaic plots, etc.
- Understand Type I and Type II statistical error, including p-values and power analysis.
- Understand ordinary least-squares regression and linear models in general•
- Learn the fundamentals of strong experimental design
- Learn to apply general linear models to basic univariate analysis problems,
    including Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
- Learn nonparametric approaches to parameter estimate and statistical
    inference, including resampling (bootstrapping), permutation, and rank-
    based analysis.
- Understand how to analyze binary response variables and frequency-based
    (e.g. contingency table) data sets.

## Course Organization

**In-class assignments:** During the course of the class, you will gain practice via in-
class assignments. It is anticipated that you will be able to complete most of these
during in-class lab time, but you are free to work on them outside of class. While
these assignments will not be graded per se, students will receive participation
points based on their commitment to these exercises during class, and a weekly
written (< 1 page) summary of what they learned from the exercises - 10% of grade

**Problem sets:** Students will be assigned five problem sets to complete during outside
of class time. These will mostly focus on one or a few data sets each, and the goal
will be for the students to organize, visualize, analyze, and interpret the data sets
in light of specific scientific motivations. - 90% of grade

**Preparing and submitting assignments:** The information required to complete all
in-class assignments and problem sets will be given in class. Students should
carefully follow the detailed instructions associated with each assignment.
Students are encouraged to work together and share information. In particular,
some students will have a higher skill level than others, and we encourage those
students with more experience to help their peers. *However, no direct sharing
of code is allowed – each student must write their own code.*

Assignments will be submitted on Canvas in the form of R Markdown files, with
the rendered html output. Be sure to include your name on the document. Be
professional – appropriately name your files, make sure they are organized, and
submit only the information requested. Late assignments will not be accepted.
